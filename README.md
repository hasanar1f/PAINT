Paper: [Fixing Imbalanced Attention to Mitigate In-Context Hallucination of Large Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12206)

The goal of this project is to mitigate the in context hallucination of LLaVA by tweaking its attention mask during token generation.
The code base is based on [PAI (ECCV 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21771).
